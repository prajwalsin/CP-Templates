x & (-x) = last set bit in x 

x += x & (-x) 
This operation sets first 0th bit from having a set bit before it to 1
Example Let n = 100 and index = 21

21 = 10101 -> 10110 -> 11000 -> 100000 -> 1000000 -> 10000000  (suffix length of continuous 0 keeps on increasing)
       21       22       24       32         64        128

Thus it takes log2(n) steps max to cross n

Now What indexes do BIT[x] have
Let x = 20
10100 
so all indexes who would have reached 10100 during their update process will be present in BII[x]
Following steps can be used to find such index 
Find Least Significant Bit (LSB) in x 
in all those indices we are looking for LSB must be UNSET
Bits before LSB can take any value 
Bit  after  LSB must be exact same 
so the numbers are of form  100xy  
BIT[i] = a[i] + a[i-1] + ... + a[i-(1<<LSB)+1]
