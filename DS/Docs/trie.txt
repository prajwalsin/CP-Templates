Main Components of Trie are 

1) Structure of Trie node
When we insert string consisting if lowecase alphabets it generally looks like This
... denotes we can add other properties to each node
struct node{
    struct node* child[25];
    bool is end
    ...
}

for inserteing number in binary format 

struct node{
    struct node* next_bit[2];
}

2) getnode() method is mandatory to assign memory to a node
3) insert() to add new number/string to the Structure
4) search() to search if a number/string is already inserted
3) a mehtod to solve the problem statement like minxor/autosuggest
